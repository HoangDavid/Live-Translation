# Live Translation Pipeline

### Currently a work in progress

A low-latency live translation pipeline designed to provide real-time captions, translation, and dubbing for video conferencing and streaming applications. The system prioritizes speed and lightweight deployment by leveraging Faster Whisper Tiny for speech-to-text, OPUS-MT models for machine translation, and Piper for text-to-speech synthesis.
